        <br/>
        <h3>Why is I.T important in modern businesses?</h3>
            <p> Technology plays a vital role in the business world. It provides the tools and functions on which<br/>
                almost all companies throughout the world run. With the advent of new technologies, the use of computers<br/>
                and Internet has increase demand for skills programmers and business are able to reach more customers than before.</p>
                <br/>


        <h3> How can you complete any digital project successfully</h3>
            <p> To complete any project successfully, whether it's a digital project or not, you will need three things.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A clear method on how to tackle the project</li>
                    <li>Basic digital understanding of how to use your chosen software </li>
                    <li>Make sure you have the basic resources needed to start up the project</li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
        <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>
        <p>Most digital companies tends to use some form of task management software or platform to help them with their projects.<br/>
           I personally use Trello, a project management platform to help teams organise and breakdown they projects into smaller tasks.<br/>
        Here is a <a href="https://trello.com/b/ayUcD0rz/it-blog">link</a> to view my current project on Trello.</p>
          <br/>
        <h3>Describe the risk that might impact digital projects</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Departmental Capacity, too much to do, day-to-day tasks getting the way;<br/>
                people or time.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Finding people with the right skills and knowledge in time to do the job</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Not identify from the beginning who the decision maker is in case the project<br/>
                manager is absent.</li>
          </ul>
              <br/>
        <h3>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Using communication platform such as Slack, Which is great for team projects and sharing files</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Starting by breaking down the tasks by using Project management application such as Trello</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Deploy your work on GitHub which is a version control platform as well a tracking file system.<br/> Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/newprojects2019"> GitHub</a></li>
                  <br/>
                </ul>
                <br/>
        <h3>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Slack has helped me keep up to date with what my teammates are discussing<br/>
              regarding the project. This includes up loaded files, links and snippets of codes.</li>
              <br/>
            <li>With Trello I am laying out the tasks needed to be completed to help me meet deadline.</li>
              <br/>
            <li>GitHub helps tracks my files for any changes and if any team member wanted to see what<br/>
                I have done so far, they can clone or pull from my repository at anytime.</li>
          </ul>
            <br/>
        <h3>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital project</h3>
        <p>There are a few rules businesses must follow when it comes to General Data Protection Regulation, these are as followed:<br/></p>
        
          <ul>
            <br/>
          <li>The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they<br/>
          withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have<br/>
          the right to have their data deleted.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request<br/>
              access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company<br/>
              after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data<br/>
              free of charge and in electronic format if requested.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing<br/>
              of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing<br/>
              must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear<br/>
              to individuals at the very start of any communication.</li>
