        <h3>Why is I.T important in modern businesses</h3>
            <p> Technology plays a vital role in the business world. It provides <br/> 
                the tools and functions on which almost all companies throughout 
                <br/>the world run. With the advent of new technologies, the use 
                <br/>of computers and Internet has increase</p>
                <br/>


        <h3> How can you complete any digital project successfully</h3>
                <p> To complete any project successfully, whether it's a digital project or not, you will need three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A clear method on how to tackle the project</li>
                    <li>Basic digital understanding of how to use your chosen software </li>
                    <li>Make sure you have the resources to start up the project</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
        <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>
        <p>You can use Trello, a project management platform to help complete project tasks.<br/>

          <br/>
        <h3>Describe the risk that might impact digital projects</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Departmental Capacity Too much to do, day-to-day tasks getting the way; not enough<br/>
                people or time and this project getting the way.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Finding the right people in time to do the job</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Too many committee decisions Artistic direction becomes muddied due to too many<br/>
                stakeholders Mitigation: In the end something that is creative needs creative direction.<br/>
                Identify who does that straight from the go and define their influence and make it clear<br/>
                to everyone, that they are the final arbiter</li>
          </ul>
              <br/>
        <h3>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
                <ul>

                <br/>
        <h3>Analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Slack has helped me keep up to date with what my team are discussing<br/>
              regarding any tasks and sharing any files or links related to the project</li>
              <br/>
            <li>With Trello I am laying out the tasks needed to be completed to help me meet the deadline</li>
              <br/>
            <li>GitHub helps tracks my files for any changes and my team mates can clearly see and obtain any changes I have made.</li>

        <p>There are a few rules businesses follow when it comes to General Data Protection Regulation, these are as followed:<br/></p>
        
          <ul>
            <br/>
          <li>The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they<br/>
          withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have<br/>
          the right to have their data deleted.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request<br/>
              access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company<br/>
              after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data<br/>
              free of charge and in electronic format if requested.</li>
          <br/>
          <li>The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing<br/>
              of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing<br/>
              must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear<br/>
