        <h3>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - making your own<br/>
            website are you happy with the tools you used?</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>I have found using codePen extremely helpful when it came to finding creative ways of designing <br/>
                    the site and making it more visually pleasing.<br/></li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Because I'm familar with how Visual Studio Code works, I was very confident in starting<br/>
                    coding my project.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>I honest did not find Trello useful because I am working alone and I find writing<br/>out all the task slighty tedious.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
        <h3>Strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
                <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The layout of the site is easy to follow and looks clean.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>The background, font size and colour makes the site more readable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Having more time for the project would have been beneficial</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>The use of JavaScript would have been better to make the website more interactive</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Not enough knowledge using other and better software such as Saas and Flexbox to help<br/>
                        improve the look of the website.</li>
                            <br/>
                            </ul>
        <h3>Further changes to the site would be...</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To add some animation to the home page</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Using a trendier font would make the site look more professional</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Adding a picture on the About page would be nicer to relate more to the user.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>The use of illustrations on the navigation bar would have be more professional and make<br/>
                        the site more accessible to those who have difficulties reading.</li>
                        <br/>

             <li>The use of Bootstraps would been useful in completing the project as well as clear creative directions<br/> 
                just to so what is required to pass the course work is clear.</li>
                <br/>
            <li>Using React Framework would be made the coding more efficient as this is more powerful than HTLM</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Because of the requirement for this project, working in a tram of more than 2 would have not been an<br/> 
                efficient as this is not big enough project.

                            be helpful. In this case I have used trello but there are other platform such as Monday.com<br/>
                            and smartsheet. Personally I would want to use trello for a smaller project within a small team<br/>

                            waiting for a team mate or colleague.</li>
                    </ul>
